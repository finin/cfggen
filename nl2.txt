# A simple context free grammar (CFG) for English.  Rules are like:
# LHS -> RHS where a RHS is a sequence of alternatives separated by
# vertical bars.  Multiple rules for a LHS symbol are OK and RHS
# alternatives can be repeated to make them more likely.

S    ->  NP VP
NP   ->  DET ADJS N       # All NPs have ADJS
ADJS ->  ADJ | ADJ ADJS   # ADJS expands to one or more ADJ
VP   ->  V | V NP         # direct object NP is optional

#  rules for pre-terminals produce words
DET  ->  the | a | no | this | that
N    ->  man | ball | woman | table | penguin | garden gnome | ghost | apple
V    ->  loves | hates | hit | took | saw | liked | loved | painted | wanted 
ADJ  ->  large | small | funny | weird | crazy | green | grotesque | creepy
